=============================

program file memory map:
code in executable file relationship:
./code-exec-mapping.png

file memory mapping:
./file-mem-mapping.png

=============================

sections usage:

stack section:
become existing after program run, it is foundation of program

bss section:
uninitialize global variable and static variable

text section:
executable code in program

data section:
initialized global variable and static variable

rodata section:
constant in program, string constant

===============================

corresponding relationship:
static storage represents .bss and .data section in program,
local variable space is on stack,
dynamic memory space is on heap,
executable code is on .text
