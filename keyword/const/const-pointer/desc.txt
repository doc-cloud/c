there is '*', left value - right pointer

const is on the left side of '*', the data pointer point to is constant value

const int *p;
int const *p;

p is changable, the data pointer point to is unchangable.

right pointer:
const is on the right side of '*', the pointer is constant value

int *const p;
p is unchangable, the content p refer to is changable.

both left value and right pointer
const int * const p;

p itself and the content refer to is unchangable.
