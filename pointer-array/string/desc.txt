========================

concept:
there is no string type in C, use character array to simulate string
string is character array end up with '\0' essentially,
it can be allocated in stack, heap, and read-only section

=========================

string length:
the number of characters contained in string,
the string length is the number of characters before the first '\0' in a string,
confirm the string length by '\0',
note:
	the return value of strlen is define to unsigned int,
	it can not be negative when they subtract with each other.

===========================

strcpy implementation

==========================

strcpy VS strncpy:

string function without limit
judge length by '\0',
strcpy, strcat, make sure that destination can save total string,
strcmp, do not change parameter value, end up with '\0', import parameter must contain '\0',
improvement:
	limited length string function

string function with limit
strncpy,
when source string less than len, remain space fill in '\0',
when source string more than len, len characters will be dupicate, it will not end up with '\0'

strncat copy n characters to destination string at maximum, always append '\0' after result string,
it will not padding the remain space in destination string by '\0'

strncmp just compare pre n characters equality.
