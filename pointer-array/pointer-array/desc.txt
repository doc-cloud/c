compiler allocate a continuous space when array declare,

pointer declaration allocate 4 bytes for the storage of pointer,
as function parameter, array parameter is same as pointer parameter,
array name can be regard as constant pointer in many case, the value is unchangable,
pointer is variable essentially, the stored value can be regard as address in memory
