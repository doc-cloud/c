=================================

C operations are base on memory,
variable and array are memory alias, how to allocate this memory is determined in compile stage,
must define length when array definition, the array length confirmed in compile stage

but the memory is not always enough

=================================

void *malloc(size_t size);

void free(void *ptr);

malloc may allocate more memory than parameter, do not rely on this

void* calloc(size_t num, size_t size);
void* realloc(void* pointer, size_t new_size);

calloc parameters represent the type info of returned memory, calloc will initialize it as 0,

realloc use for modify an allocated memory block
after use realloc, should use its' return value
when the first parameter is NULL, it is equal to malloc

calloc is unit with type size to allocate memory and initialize
realloc can reset memory size
