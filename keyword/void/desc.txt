left side of assignment expression, accept any type pointer,
right side of assignment expression, type convertion acquired,

the same type pointer assign each other.

void is empty type, C standard has no rule for it, a specific compiler should define it by itself.

there is no void variable, C has no rule for void alias, how much memory it has? I don't know.
