============================

stack:
maintain function invoking context, no function, local variable if there is no stack,

store info need by a function invoking
function parameter, return address,
local variable,
function invoking context,
old ebp:return pointer

=============================

heap:
data on stack is release after function return,
you cannot return function local variable, eg:local array

heap is a large free space, use for program freely,
it is effective before initiative release,

free list, bit map, object pool,

store global variable, static variable,(said in of)

=================================

static memory

allocate memory along with program running, until program end, storage space size was confirmed in compile stage,
global variable and static variable, store in execuate file

when multi users develop a project, there can be function rename, functions will disturb each other in different files,
so we do need static function to use in the files which defined them, they are internal functions
