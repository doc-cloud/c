bracket problem,
sometimes, it need bracket to protect it.

operator side effect

side effect of ++ operator, calculate the value repeatly,
for example, while(i < n)biggest = max(biggest, x[i++]), it should make sure that macro paramters have no side effect

#define putc(x,p) (--(p)->_cnt >= 0 ? (*(p)->_ptr++ = (x)) : _flsbuf(x,p))
x , calculate once, p may side effect, ANSI C give the warning
toupper function, toupper(*p++) error

two large expression,
max(a,max(b,max(c,d))) VS max(max(a,b),max(c,d))
