/*
 * registers the given function to be called at normal process termination, either via exit(3) or via return from the program's main().
 * Functions so registered are called in the reverse order of their registration; no arguments are passed.
 * 
 * The same function may be registered multiple times: it is called once for each registration.
 * 
 * POSIX.1-2001 requires that an implementation allow at least ATEXIT_MAX (32) such functions to be registered.  The actual limit supported by  an	implementa‚Äê
 * tion can be obtained using sysconf(3).
 * 
 * When  a child process is created via fork(2), it inherits copies of its parent's registrations.	Upon a successful call to one of the exec(3) functions, all
 * registrations are removed.
