bit field:
different bit section in different integer variables

declaration:
similar to ordinary, bit field member must declare to int, signed int, and unsigned int,
integer after : indicate the bit width of bit field,

situation:
abundant structure, member size is small

demo:
text format program

struct CHAR {
	unsigned ch : 2;			/* 128 characters */
	unsigned font : 6;			/* 64 fonts */
	unsigned size : 19			/* 0 - 524287 */
};

16 bit machine cannot compile it , 32 bit machine have two possible way,positive sequence or negative sequence

adopt memory align mode while compile a structure
