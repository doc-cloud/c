# glibc

	Some demo programs,

	On the consideration of my goddamn bad memory, I write some atomic demo program,

	they describe an interface obviously, and they can be good for your quick fetch.

	Trace it to lowlevel source code, even to the electronic plus, if you is a real explorer.

	If you have good demos for stable interface, please give me patches.

	Thanks!
