pointer operations:
p + n = (unsigned int)p + sizeof(*p) * n

just subtract between pointers, and they must be same type,
p1 - p2 = ((unsigned int)p1 - (unsigned int)p2) / sizeof(type)

the subtract has significance when the pointers point to elements in the same array,
result is the subscript difference of elements which be pointed.
the result is undefined when the array is not the same one.
